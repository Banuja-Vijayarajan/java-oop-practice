📝 Question:
Create a Java class named Employee that maintains a count of how many employee objects have been created 
using a static variable called employeeCount.

Every time a new Employee object is instantiated (i.e., a new employee is created), 
the static variable employeeCount should be incremented by 1.

Add a constructor to initialize the employee’s name and ID.
Also include a static method called getEmployeeCount() that returns the total number of employees created so far.

Finally, in the main method, create several Employee objects and print the total number of employees using the static method.

📌 Concepts Tested:
Static variables
Object instantiation
Static methods
Constructors
Access modifiers

🧠 Bonus Tip:
This question helps you understand the difference between instance variables (unique for each object) and static variables (shared across all objects of the class).
